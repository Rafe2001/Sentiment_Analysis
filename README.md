# Sentiment Analysis Project
This project is a sentiment analysis tool built with Python that analyzes the sentiment of a given text. The tool uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify the sentiment of the text as positive, negative, or neutral.
# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
To run the tool, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need to install the following Python packages:

nltk

scikit-learn

pandas

numpy

# How it Works
The sentiment analysis tool uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify the sentiment of a given text. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled text data, where each text is labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

The tool uses the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) package to preprocess the text data and extract features from the text. The features are then fed into the machine learning model, which predicts the sentiment of the text.
